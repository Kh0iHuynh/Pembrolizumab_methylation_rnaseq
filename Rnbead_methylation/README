rnbeadsrun.sh is a batch file to run RnBeads package
rnbead.r is the actual Rscript for RnBeads
sample_annotation_test.csv is the sample metadata file for rnbead.r

After RnBeads run finished, beta_1.csv beta table was extracted, was liftover to hg38 coordinate, 
and was transposed following liftover_procedure. 

transpose_methylation_table.r is the transpose script using R for liftover_procedure.Metadata for samples
is deseq_metadata_withouthyphen.csv. transposed_methylation.txt is the result


NOTE: in deseq_metadata_withouthyphen.csv and liftover beta tables, all sample names should not have "-" 


## Methyl resolver step
methylresolver.sh is the bash script to run methyresolver.r using methyresolver_data.txt
methylresolver_data.txt is the data file contain beta value of each samples as columns and row name is the name of cpg.
methylresolver_data.txt in this github is an example


## ANOVA and random mixed model effect
beta value is transformed using ln(beta +5).
methylation_anova.r is the ANOVA script
methylation_lme4.r is the script for random mixed model effect
anova_methylation_result.txt is the example result of methylation_anova.r
cell_type_analysis.r is the Rscript to run ANOVA on immune cell contents from MethylResolver

## Combine methylation anova and DE gene location 
merge_methylation_deseq_bycoord.sh is the script to process and combine methylation anova results and DE gene results
de_and_methylation_anova_result.txt is the result (-log(0.05) = 1.301)
