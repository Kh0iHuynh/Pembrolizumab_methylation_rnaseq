RNAseq.sh to run salmon aligment and to generate tpm quant file for deseq2:
  1. namelist.txt is the SRR list for RNAseq.sh
Deseq_analysis.sh to run deseq2 analysis
  1. deseq.r : deseq2 script
  2. deseq2 meta data is deseq_metadata.csv
  3. anova_deseq.r : anova script on deseq2 normalized count to confirm deseq2 result if needed. Also to combine deseq2 normalized data and sample metadata
    1. normalized count table :normalized_counts.txt
    2. normalized count with metadata: normalized_count_with_metadata.txt

  4. deseq.r result files are 
    1. deseq_result_cohort.txt
    2. deseq_result_interaction.txt
    3. deseq_result_survival.txt
Converttranscript.sh convert the transcript name to gene name. Result are
  1. deseq_result_cohort_ensgene.txt
  2. deseq_result_interaction_ensgene.txt
  3. deseq_result_survival_ensgene.txt
Extract_gene_start_stop.sh is a script to extract start stop of DE gene from gencode v45 annotation
  1. DE_gene.txt is the list of all ENSG gene name found to be DE
  2. gencode.v45_gene_annotation_table.txt is the annotation of gene v45 from gencode.
  3. result file is DE_gene_withstartstop.txt
Convert ensemble gene id to entrez gene id:
  1. DE_gene.txt list is copie to g:Profiler covnert function. Organism is Homo sapien and Targetnamespace is ENTREZGENE_ACC
  2. ensembletoentrez.csv is result. It is further editted to new format as follows:
    a. sed 's/ /_/g' ensembletoentrez.csv | sed 's/,/ /g' | awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$4}' > ensembletoentrez.txt
    b. header of ensembletoentrez.txt is  "ensgene entrez_id name description" 
GO analysis:
  1. goanalysis.sh is the script used to prepare deseq significant genes for PANTHER go analysis:
    a. genes are filtered by their change in regulation according to their fold change: > 1 (up), <-1 (down), and -1 < + < 1 (neutral)
    b. genes are then pasted onto PANTHER for GO analysis: https://geneontology.org/
      + survival_up, survival_down, survival_neutral, interaction_up, interaction_down
    c. results are combined into one final PANTHER result file: panther_go_analysis.txt.

DE significant genes for all categories (1 to 3 use adj-pvalue, 4 use normal pvalue):
  1. by survival :deseq_significant_survival.txt
    a. expression for each samples for each genes are: gene_survival_expression.txt
  2. by cohort :deseq_significant_cohort.txt
    a. expression for each samples for each genes are: gene_cohort_expression.txt
  3. by interaction :deseq_significant_interaction.txt
    a. expression for each samples for each genes are: gene_interaction_expression.txt
  4. by cohort using only patients who survive more than 8 months : deseq_significant_onlyoverpatient_cohort.txt
    a. expression for each samples for each genes are: onlyovergene_cohort_expression.txt
